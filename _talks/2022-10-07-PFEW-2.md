We will present a semantics for modal logic based on simplicial complexes that instead of possible worlds uses an "Agent Perspective". Philip will explain the details of the formalism, including a novel soundness and completeness proof. Brittany will follow up with some applications of these models to a distributed setting. Additionally, she will show how we can use tools from algebraic topology to show a variety of things including the nonexistence of bisimulations.
