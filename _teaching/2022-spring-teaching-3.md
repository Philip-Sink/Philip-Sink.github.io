Instructor of Record for the course 80-210 ''Logic and Proofs''. Syllabus [here](http://philip-sink.github.io/files/80210SyllabusSpr2022.pdf).

``Logic & Proofs (L&P) is a web-based course which introduces students to modern
symbolic logic. It focuses primarily on strategies for constructing and refuting
arguments. In service of this primary focus, L&P offers a wealth of online
instructional materials which will help students develop an understanding of:
i. the logical form of statements;
ii. syntactic inference rules that allow the construction of logically correct
arguments;
iii. strategies for crafting arguments that use these rules;
iv. semantic techniques that facilitate the development of counterexamples to
arguments (showing them to be logically incorrect).
By the end of this course, students will find themselves introduced to and familiar
with the following (this is not an exhaustive list):
● Logical interpretation of statements and arguments.
● The structure and validity (or invalidity) of arguments.
● The syntax of sentential and predicate (quantificational) logic.
● The semantics of sentential and predicate logic.
● Counterexamples.
● Finally: inference rules, proofs, and strategies for arguments.''
