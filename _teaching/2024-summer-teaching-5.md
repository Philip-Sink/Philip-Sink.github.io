Instructor of Record for the course 80-212 ''Arguments and Logical Analysis''. Syllabus [here](http://philip-sink.github.io/files/80212SyllabusSum2024.pdf).

``What counts as a “successful” argument? Is it one based on evidence? If so, what counts as “good” evidence?
Suppose we could answer this question - is that enough? What does it mean to “base” an argument on
evidence? Surely there are incorrect ways to deploy even very good evidence. Can we categorize them?
Questions such as the above form the basis of the branch of philosophy known as “epistemology”. Epistemology
is the study of “reasoning”. It answers questions both concerning how we ought to properly reason,
but also how we tend to reason in practice. Broadly speaking, this course is focused on exploring epistemology.
We will be focused on different ways of understanding what counts as a “successful” argument. We hope
to be able to not only identify and distinguish such arguments from unsuccessful ones, but to understand
the myriad and complex ways in which such arguments work.
This course will also take an even narrower approach. Epistemology is (literally) an ancient discipline, but
massive strides have been made in the last 100-150 years, particularly connecting concepts in epistemology
up to those in formal mathematics. This is a branch of mathematical modeling, or applied mathematics,
known as “formal epistemology”. These different mathematical models have made exploring the nuances of
argumentation more feasible than ever before.
However, our purposes are more applied. The limitations of a semester mean that we only have so much
time to delve into the nuances of formal epistemology. So, the course aims to introduce a handful of the
most basic and universal formal epistemic tools, namely those of Boolean logic and probability theory. With
these in hand, the second half of the course is dedicated to the application of these tools. It would be quite
frustrating and disappointing of these formal tools did not, in fact, help us to understand more day to day
arguments, but instead remained abstract tools. So the second half of this course is dedicated to applying
what we learn in the first half towards arguments made in first natural science, and then political science.
The hope is that these formal tools will let us not only understand how rich and complex some of these
arguments are, but they will help us to more subtly and carefully evaluate these arguments, understand
where some succeed, and where others fail.''
