Instructor of Record for the course 80-150 ''Nature of Reason''. Syllabus [here](http://philip-sink.github.io/files/80150SyllabusSum2025.pdf).

``This course provides an accessible introduction to the historical development, within the Western tradition,
of philosophical ideas regarding the nature of reasoning and rationality from ancient to modern times, with
a focus on mathematics and the sciences. The course is divided into three parts. The first part traces the
search for deductive methods for obtaining certain knowledge, starting with Euclid and Aristotle, all the way
to the work of Boole and Frege in the nineteenth century, which marks the beginning of modern logic. The
second part focuses on the history of skepticism about empirical knowledge and inductive reasoning, covering
the ideas of philosophers such as Descartes and Hume, along with various replies to skepticismâ€”for instance,
in the works of Bayes. The third and final part of the course is devoted to discussing the development and
the basic elements of the theory of computation, as well as the most prominent theories of the nature of
the mind and mental processes, culminating in the computational conception of the mind that underlies
contemporary cognitive science.''
