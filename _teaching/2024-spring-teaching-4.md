Instructor of Record for the course 80-100 ''Introduction to Philosophy''. Syllabus [here](http://philip-sink.github.io/files/80100SyllabusSpr2024.pdf).

``Do we have free will? What is the nature of consciousness? What is truth? These are the sorts of questions
that keep us up at night. The purpose of philosophy is to make sense of these questions and attempt to answer
them. In the tradition we shall be primarily exploring, philosophy proceeds via arguments. Philosophers
begin with some conclusion they wish to argue for, some assumptions, and proceed via some process of
inference from those assumptions to that conclusion. We call these sequences of inferences arguments.
Breaking down philosophical arguments can help you to break down arguments you encounter in your day
to day life, and help you to more adeptly and clearly construct arguments of your own.''
