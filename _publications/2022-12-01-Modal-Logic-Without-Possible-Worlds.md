excerpt: 'In this paper, we set out to give a novel semantics for modal logic in simplicial complexes. The motivation for this semantics will be first the replacement of possible worlds with the idea of an "agent perspective". After exploring some of the philosophical implications of such a move, we give a semantics based around this idea. Following this, we explore some of the more interesting consequences of such a system, in particular the soundness of an unusual axiom we call NU^*. After giving soundness and completeness, we conclude by exploring ways to weaken this axiom in our semantics.'

<p>This paper represents my earliest work in simplicial semantics, completed for the <a href="https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/public/s/course-offering/a0Bt000000AUvwUEAT/topology-and-modal-logic">Internship in Topology and Modal Logic</a> with NASA LaRC. Ultimately, this work became the bedrock of my master's thesis, and later my doctoral thesis. Unfortunately, the given manuscript has one major error in its presentation: my solution for assigning truth values to atoms at a facet can falsify some formulas assigned to that facet. Later work solves this error. A link to the paper as seen in the technical reports server may be found <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220015748">here</a>.</p>
