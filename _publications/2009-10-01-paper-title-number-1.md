excerpt: 'In this note we provide an algorithm for translating relational structures into "proper" relational structures, i.e., those such that there is no pair of worlds w and u such that w is accessible from u for every agent. In particular, our method of translation preserves many classical properties of relational structures, such as transitivity and the Euclidean property. As a result, this method of translation has many applications in the literature on Simplicial Semantics for modal logic, where the creation of proper canonical relational structures is a common step in proofs of completeness.
